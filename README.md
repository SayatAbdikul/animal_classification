# Models for animal classification
This repo has some models for animal classification on dataset animals-10. Dataset is from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10
## Models
### EfficientNet on 5 classes:
Baseline model is EfficientNet-B0, and the accuracy is ~62% <br>
The main model is EfficientNet-B1 and the best accuracy was in the range of 69-71%
I did not train other versions because they require too much computational force.
